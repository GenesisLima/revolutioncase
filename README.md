# revolutiocase
This project is a resulting product of my master's degree research.
 The RevolutionCASE Tool enables the developer to automatically and visually execute structural refactor on a production database. 
 RevolutionCASE has the following features: 
 - Partial Reverse Engineering: the developer brings to the canvas only the concerning tables to refactor 
 - Modelling Language: using a unique language to model both relational and refactoring, the RevolutionCASE tool delivers simple constructors and properties to set up and run the refactoring quickly 
- Script Generation or Forward Engineering: It's up to the developer whether he wants to run the refactoring straight from the tool or copy the script from the Script View
